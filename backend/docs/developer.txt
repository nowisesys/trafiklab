** Files:

    jour.json: contains all lines/route stops.
    stop.json: extra information on route stops.

** Relations:

    jour.JourneyPatternPointNumber -> stop.StopPointNumber

** Packages:

    nowise.model:   JSON bindnings
    nowise.server:  HTTP server
    nowise.remote:  Proxy against trafiklab

** Notes:

    1.  In a real-world scenario, the HTTP request should be done in
        parallel using async requests.

    2.  Use local cached files for development. In production this 
        should also be done with a cron job for updates.

        Modify this method to enable local cache:

            private boolean isCaching() {
                return false;
            }
